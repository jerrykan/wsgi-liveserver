wsgi-liveserver
===============
wsgi-liveserver provides a simple LiverServerTestCase class that can be used to
help start a web server in the background to serve a WSGI compliant application
for use with testing. Generally it will be used in conjuction with something
like Selenium to perform a series of functional tests using a browser.

Installation and Dependencies
-----------------------------
Install wsgi-liveserver with ``pip install wsgi-liveserver`` or just `download
wsgi_liveserver.py <http://github.com/jerrykan/wsgi-liveserver>`_ and place it
in your project directory. There are no dependencies other than the Python
Standard Library.


Usage
-----
The wsgi-liveserver LiveServerTestCase can be used instead of unittest.TestCase
for any tests that require a running web server. Simply define a create_app()
method that returns the wsgi application that you want to have started up in
the background, then write your tests as normal. LiveServerTestCase will handle
starting and stopping the server for you.

Port Range
~~~~~~~~~~
By default `LiveServerTestCase` will attempt to listen on the first available
port in the range 8080-8090 (inclusive). If you wish the LiveServer to attempt
to listen on a different range of ports this can be done by setting the
`port_range` class attribute (see the example below).


Example
-------
The following is a very basic example of using wsgi-liveserver with the
`wsgiref demo_app
<http://docs.python.org/2/library/wsgiref.html#wsgiref.simple_server.demo_app>`_:

.. code-block:: python

    import unittest
    from wsgiref.simple_server import demo_app
    from selenium import webdriver
    from wsgi_liveserver import LiveServerTestCase

    class SimpleTest(LiveServerTestCase):
        port_range = (9001, 9010)  # default is (8080, 8090)

        def create_app(self):
            return demo_app

        def setUp(self):
            self.driver = webdriver.Firefox()

        def tearDown(self):
            self.driver.close()

        def test_page_title(self):
            self.driver.get(self.url_base())
            self.assertTrue('Hello world!' in self.driver.page_source)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()
